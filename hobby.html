    <h1>My hobbies</h1>
    <h3>Everyone has a favorite hobby. I have also a favorite hobby. My favorite hobby is cycling. It is my favorite sports to do whenever I have free time.  Not just because of it good for our health, if we also can enjoy the scenery and feel the natural winds. It is a good exercise to improve family relationships or a friend’s relationships. Most of the time I am cycling with my best friend, while we cycling we were chatting or even gossiping about anything. You have to find the perfect place to cycling harmoniously without any destruction such as a park, housing area or anyplace, as long as that place has a good road, so that you won’t fall because of the road.</h3>

    <h3 class="qwert">Some hobbies require a lot of equipment, but cameras are cheaper than ever. A few decades ago, being a photographer meant having to buy your film stock and gain access to a dark room to develop your own photos. These days, you already have a camera on your smartphone.</h3>
